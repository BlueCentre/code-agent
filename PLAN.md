# Code Agent Project Plan

> Note: This document has been superseded by `docs/implementation.md` which contains the current implementation status and roadmap. This file is retained for reference of the original vision and future enhancement ideas.

## 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the plan for building a versatile Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance developer productivity by leveraging AI language models directly within the terminal.

**Vision:** To create a powerful, flexible CLI tool that allows users to leverage various AI language models for tasks such as code generation, explanation, refactoring, terminal command assistance, and general question answering, directly within the terminal environment.

**Core Goal:** Provide a unified interface to interact with multiple AI model providers (supporting the OpenAI API standard) and empower the agent with capabilities to interact with the user's local environment (files, terminal commands) in a controlled and secure manner.

## 2. Configuration Hierarchy
Prioritize configuration settings: CLI flags > Environment Variables > config.yaml file (e.g., ~/.config/code-agent/config.yaml).

## 3. Future Enhancements

For implementation progress, please refer to `docs/implementation.md`.

These potential future enhancements could be considered after completing the core functionality:

* **Advanced Memory Management**:
  * Long-term conversation memory using vector databases
  * Knowledge extraction and summarization for extended conversations
  * Context windowing techniques for managing token limits

* **Extended Tool Capabilities**:
  * Dynamic tool discovery and registration system
  * Git-specific tooling for repository management
  * Project analysis tools (codebase understanding)
  * Integration with code quality tools and test runners

* **Enhanced Collaboration**:
  * Session sharing between team members
  * History export and import features
  * Collaborative editing capabilities

* **User Interface Improvements**:
  * Optional TUI (Text User Interface) with interactive components
  * Terminal-based code editor integration
  * Syntax-highlighted diffs with interactive application

* **Integration Possibilities**:
  * Integration with IDEs via plugins/extensions
  * Integration with version control systems
  * CI/CD pipeline integration

* **Customization**:
  * Plugin architecture for community contributions
  * Custom tool development framework
  * Template system for common tasks
