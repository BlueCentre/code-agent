# Memory Integration with ADK Sessions

This document details the integration of structured memory management with Google ADK sessions.

## Memory Management Architecture

The memory management implementation consists of several key components that work together to provide a comprehensive system for maintaining contextual awareness across user interactions:

### 1. Memory Types

Our memory implementation supports several distinct memory types:

- **Short-Term Memory**: Stores recent user interactions and queries, with a limited timespan
- **Long-Term Memory**: Persists important information across multiple sessions
- **Working Memory**: Tracks active tool executions and their results
- **Semantic Memory**: Stores conceptual knowledge (associations, categories, etc.)
- **Episodic Memory**: Records sequences of events and their temporal relationships

### 2. Memory Components

#### `MemoryType` Enum
Defines the supported types of memory that can be managed.

```python
class MemoryType(str, Enum):
    """Types of memory supported by the memory manager."""
    SHORT_TERM = "short_term"
    LONG_TERM = "long_term"
    SEMANTIC = "semantic"
    EPISODIC = "episodic"
    WORKING = "working"
```

#### `MemoryEntry` Class
Represents a single memory item with metadata.

```python
class MemoryEntry(BaseModel):
    """An entry in agent memory."""
    content: str
    memory_type: MemoryType
    importance: float = 1.0
    timestamp: Optional[str] = None
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

#### `MemoryManager` Class
Manages storage, retrieval, and processing of memories for a specific session.

Key methods include:
- `add_memory`: Stores new memory entries
- `get_memories`: Retrieves memories by type and importance
- `clear_memories`: Removes memories
- `extract_memories_from_session`: Analyzes session events to create memories
- `summarize_conversation`: Generates a coherent summary from memories

### 3. Memory Integration with Sessions

Memory management is tightly integrated with the ADK session management through several integration points:

1. **Session-Memory Mapping**: Each session has a dedicated `MemoryManager` instance that maintains its memory state.

2. **Event Processing**: When events are added to a session, relevant memory entries are automatically created:
   - User messages become short-term memories
   - Assistant responses become short-term memories
   - Tool calls become working memories
   - Tool results become working memories

3. **Memory Retrieval**: The session manager provides methods to access and manipulate memories associated with a session.

4. **Memory Serialization**: Memory state can be serialized for persistence and deserialized for restoration.

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Memory Creation

Memory entries are automatically created when using the standard session event methods:

```python
# User message automatically creates a short-term memory
await session_manager.add_user_message(session_id, "What is the capital of France?")

# Assistant response creates a short-term memory
await session_manager.add_assistant_message(session_id, "The capital of France is Paris.")

# Tool calls and results create working memories
await session_manager.add_tool_result(session_id, tool_call_id, "get_capital", "Paris")
```

### Manual Memory Management

You can also manually manage memories for more complex scenarios:

```python
# Get the memory manager for a session
memory_manager = session_manager._get_memory_manager(session_id)

# Add a custom memory
memory_manager.add_memory(
    content="User is interested in European geography",
    memory_type=MemoryType.LONG_TERM,
    importance=1.5,
    metadata={"category": "user_interests", "confidence": 0.9}
)

# Get all high-importance memories
important_memories = memory_manager.get_memories(min_importance=1.2)

# Clear short-term memories while preserving long-term ones
memory_manager.clear_memories(MemoryType.SHORT_TERM)
```

### Memory Retrieval in Agent Workflows

Memories can be accessed during agent execution to provide context:

```python
# Get all memories for the current session
memories = await session_manager.get_memories(session_id)

# Get only high-importance working memories
working_memories = await session_manager.get_memories(
    session_id, 
    memory_type=MemoryType.WORKING,
    min_importance=0.8
)

# Generate a conversation summary
summary = await session_manager.get_conversation_summary(session_id)
```

## Memory Patterns and Limitations

### Effective Memory Patterns

1. **Importance-Based Filtering**: Assign higher importance scores to critical information to ensure it's prioritized during retrieval.

2. **Metadata Enrichment**: Use metadata to add context and categorization to memories for more sophisticated filtering.

3. **Memory Type Separation**: Store different types of information in appropriate memory types to manage their lifecycle.

4. **Progressive Summarization**: Periodically summarize and consolidate short-term memories into long-term insights.

### Current Limitations

1. **No Vector Storage**: The current implementation doesn't include semantic vector embeddings for similarity search.

2. **Limited Persistence**: Memory persistence is tied to session persistence; when sessions expire, their memories are lost.

3. **No Cross-Session Memory**: Long-term memories currently don't span multiple sessions automatically.

4. **Manual Memory Management**: Some advanced memory operations require manual intervention rather than being automatic.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to memory integration include:

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Add support for semantic similarity search using embeddings.

2. **Cross-Session Persistence**: Implement user-level memory that persists across sessions.

3. **Automatic Memory Consolidation**: Implement algorithms to automatically consolidate and summarize memories.

4. **Memory Pruning**: Add mechanisms to forget less important memories when reaching capacity limits.

5. **Hierarchical Memory Organization**: Implement memory hierarchies and associations between related memories.
