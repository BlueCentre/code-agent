# Session Integration Notes

This document details the implementation of session integration using Google ADK.

## Session Lifecycle

The session lifecycle in the Code Agent application follows these stages:

1. **Creation**: Sessions are created when a new conversation is initiated or when a specific session ID is requested that doesn't already exist.
2. **Initialization**: The newly created session receives initial configuration and setup, including application name and user ID.
3. **Event Management**: Throughout its lifetime, events are added to the session history, including:
   - User messages (queries, commands)
   - Assistant messages (responses, partial responses during streaming)
   - Tool results (outcomes of tool executions)
   - Error events (when problems occur)
   - System messages (configuration or state information)
4. **Persistence**: Session state is maintained between interactions, ensuring conversation context is preserved.
5. **Retrieval**: Sessions can be retrieved by ID for continued conversations.
6. **Termination/Cleanup**: Sessions may be explicitly terminated or naturally expire based on configuration.

## Configuration Options

The `CodeAgentSessionConfig` class in `code_agent/adk/session_config.py` provides configuration options for sessions:

```python
class CodeAgentSessionConfig:
    """Configuration specific to Code Agent sessions."""
    # Placeholder for future configuration options
    pass
```

### Available Session Services

1. **InMemorySessionService** (Default)
   - Configuration: `IN_MEMORY_SESSION_CONFIG`
   - Characteristics:
     - Sessions persist only for the lifetime of the application
     - Fast access with minimal overhead
     - Suitable for development and testing
     - No persistence between application restarts

2. **FilesystemSessionService** (Planned)
   - Will provide persistence of sessions to the filesystem
   - Suitable for longer-term session storage
   - Will enable session recovery after application restarts

### Session Manager

The `CodeAgentADKSessionManager` class in `code_agent/adk/services.py` provides a high-level interface for session management with methods for:

1. **Session Management**:
   - `create_session()`: Creates a new session
   - `get_session(session_id)`: Retrieves an existing session
   - `clear_history(session_id)`: Clears the history for a session (implementation dependent)

2. **Event Management**:
   - `add_event(session_id, event)`: Generic method to add any event
   - `add_user_message(session_id, content)`: Adds a user message
   - `add_assistant_message(session_id, content, tool_calls)`: Adds an assistant response
   - `add_partial_assistant_message(session_id, content)`: Adds a streaming partial response
   - `add_tool_result(session_id, tool_call_id, tool_name, content)`: Records tool execution results
   - `add_error_event(session_id, error_message)`: Records errors
   - `add_system_message(session_id, content)`: Adds system notifications

3. **History Retrieval**:
   - `get_history(session_id)`: Returns the event history for a session

## Session Security Considerations

Session security encompasses several aspects:

1. **Authentication**: Verifying that users have access to their specific sessions
2. **Isolation**: Ensuring sessions don't interfere with each other
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks or resource exhaustion
4. **Data Protection**: Safeguarding sensitive information stored in sessions

The current implementation focuses on basic functionality, with security features planned for future implementation.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to session management include:

1. **Enhanced Persistence**: Implementation of FilesystemSessionService
2. **Memory Integration**: Integration with structured memory components
3. **Security Boundaries**: Implementation of authentication and authorization
4. **Session Timeouts**: Configurable session expiration and cleanup
5. **Enhanced Metadata**: Additional session metadata for tracking and management
