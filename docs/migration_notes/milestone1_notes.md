# Milestone 1: Setup & Dependency Management - Notes

## Overview

This document contains notes, learnings, and observations from the first milestone of the Google ADK migration project. The focus of this milestone was setting up the development environment, installing necessary dependencies, and creating the initial directory structure.

## Dependency Management

### ADK Packages

- `google-adk` (^0.2.0): Core ADK framework
- `google-cloud-aiplatform[adk]` (^1.70.0): Google Cloud AI Platform with ADK extras

### Installation Notes

The installation of dependencies uses either uv or poetry:

```bash
# Using uv (preferred for speed)
uv venv
uv pip install -e .

# Using poetry (alternative)
poetry install
```

## Directory Structure

We've created the following initial structure:

```
/
├── code_agent/
│   ├── adk/
│   │   └── __init__.py
├── sandbox/
│   └── adk_sandbox.py
└── docs/
    └── migration_notes/
        └── milestone1_notes.md
```

- `code_agent/adk/`: Will contain all ADK-specific implementations
- `sandbox/adk_sandbox.py`: Provides a playground for testing ADK components
- `docs/migration_notes/`: Houses migration documentation

## Learnings & Observations

- ADK Version: The project is using google-adk version 0.2.0
- The existing project structure matches well with our planned organization
- (Add more observations as you experiment with the sandbox)

## Next Steps

- Complete tool refactoring (Milestone 2a)
- Implement model integration (Milestone 2b)
- Begin initial integration testing

## Questions & Considerations

- (Document any questions that arise during setup)
- (Note any compatibility concerns or unexpected behaviors)
