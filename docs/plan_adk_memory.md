## Plan: Integrating Session Memory into Software Engineer Agent

This plan describes the steps for an agent to integrate session memory, improving its ability to maintain context and track task progress across user interactions.

**Prerequisite:** The agent environment and its underlying framework (ADK) must provide access to a session memory mechanism (e.g., `tool_context.session_state`). The agent's code needs to be structured such that it can be conceptually "modified" according to this plan.

---

### Step 1: Define Memory Schema and Use Cases

*   **Objective:** Identify specific pieces of information from interactions that are valuable to remember and decide on a structure (schema) for storing them in session memory.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   List key pieces of context to store, e.g:
        *   `current_project_path`: Path to the user's current project directory.
        *   `current_file_being_discussed`: Path to the file the user is currently focused on.
        *   `task_in_progress`: Details of a multi-step task (e.g., debugging, feature implementation) and its current state.
        *   `recent_search_results`: Results from recent file reads or code searches.
        *   `user_preferences`: User-specific settings or habits.
    *   Decide on keys and data types for storing this information in a dictionary or similar structure within session memory. Example structure:
        ```python
        # Conceptual memory structure
        memory = {
            "context": {
                "project_path": None,
                "current_file": None
            },
            "tasks": {
                "active_task": None, # e.g., {"type": "debugging", "step": "analyze_logs", "related_files": [...]}
                "completed_tasks": []
            },
            "history": {
                "last_read_file": None,
                "last_search_query": None
            }
            # Add other relevant fields
        }
        ```
*   **Verification:**
    *   The agent internally confirms the defined schema and use cases are documented or represented in its configuration/code logic. This is a design step verification.

---

### Step 2: Implement Writing to Memory

*   **Objective:** Modify agent logic to write relevant information to session memory after performing actions or receiving key information from the user.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Identify points in the agent's workflow where memory should be updated (e.g., after successfully reading a file, after the user specifies a project directory, after starting a new multi-step task).
    *   Add code snippets at these points to update the session memory object.
    ```python
    # Example conceptual code modification
    def handle_read_file_success(self, filepath, content):
        # ... handle file content ...
        # Update memory
        if self.tool_context and hasattr(self.tool_context, 'session_state'):
             self.tool_context.session_state['memory']['context']['current_file'] = filepath
             self.tool_context.session_state['memory']['history']['last_read_file'] = {'filepath': filepath, 'timestamp': current_time} # Optional: add timestamp
        # ... rest of the handler ...
    ```
*   **Verification:**
    *   In test scenarios, after an action that should trigger a memory write (e.g., reading a file), the agent immediately attempts to read the session memory back and asserts that the expected key-value pairs have been set correctly.
    *   Use logging/debug output to inspect the contents of session memory after write operations.

---

### Step 3: Implement Reading from Memory

*   **Objective:** Modify agent logic to read relevant information from session memory at the beginning of processing a user turn or before making decisions where past context is needed.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   At the start of processing a new user input, load relevant data from session memory into the agent's active state.
    *   Access memory contents when deciding on the next action or formulating a response.
    ```python
    # Example conceptual code modification
    def process_user_input(self, user_input):
        # Load memory
        current_context = {}
        if self.tool_context and hasattr(self.tool_context, 'session_state') and 'memory' in self.tool_context.session_state:
             current_context = self.tool_context.session_state['memory']['context']
             # Load other relevant memory sections

        # Use loaded context
        if user_input == "read the file":
            filepath_to_read = current_context.get('current_file')
            if filepath_to_read:
                self.read_file_content(filepath=filepath_to_read) # Use tool with remembered path
            else:
                # Ask the user for the file path
                self.ask_for_filepath()
        # ... rest of processing logic using memory ...
    ```
*   **Verification:**
    *   In test scenarios designed to leverage memory (e.g., "read the file" after a file path was previously set in memory), verify that the agent correctly retrieves and uses the stored information instead of asking for it again.
    *   Inspect agent's internal state or logs to confirm memory contents were loaded correctly.

---

### Step 4: Integrate Memory into Decision Making and Responses

*   **Objective:** Adjust the agent's core logic and response generation to leverage the context retrieved from memory, leading to more coherent and context-aware interactions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Modify conditional logic to branch based on memory contents (e.g., if a task is in progress, continue that task; if `current_file` is set, default operations to that file).
    *   Refine response templates to include references to past interactions or remembered context (e.g., "Continuing with debugging `login.py`...", "You previously asked about the `utils` directory...").
*   **Verification:**
    *   Run multi-turn test conversations where memory should influence the agent's behavior (e.g., asking a follow-up question about a file discussed earlier).
    *   Observe the agent's responses and actions to ensure they are contextually appropriate and demonstrate memory usage.
    *   The agent's behavior should be different and improved compared to the version without memory integration.

---

### Step 5: Develop Automated Test Cases

*   **Objective:** Create a suite of automated tests (unit and integration) to ensure memory functionality works correctly and doesn't introduce regressions.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Write unit tests for functions that specifically handle reading from and writing to session memory, mocking the memory object if necessary.
    *   Write integration tests for key use cases involving multiple turns and memory persistence (e.g., set a file, ask about the file, set a task, ask about the task state).
    *   Use a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`) and shell commands (`execute_vetted_shell_command`) to run these tests if the agent environment supports it.
    ```python
    # Conceptual shell command for running tests
    # Check safety first!
    # check_shell_command_safety(command='pytest agent_tests/')
    # execute_vetted_shell_command(command='pytest agent_tests/')
    ```
*   **Verification:**
    *   The agent runs the automated test suite.
    *   Verification is successful if all tests pass, indicating correct memory handling in tested scenarios.

---

### Step 6: Manual Testing and Refinement

*   **Objective:** Conduct realistic manual testing of the agent in various scenarios to catch issues not covered by automated tests and refine the memory usage based on practical interaction.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Interact with the agent in typical software engineering workflows, intentionally leveraging the features enhanced by memory (e.g., extended debugging sessions, working on a feature over multiple turns, switching between tasks).
    *   Gather feedback from other potential users (if available).
*   **Verification:**
    *   Observe the agent's behavior during manual testing.
    *   Memory usage feels natural and helpful to the user.
    *   Identify any instances where memory is misused, irrelevant information is remembered, or crucial information is forgotten.
    *   Refine the memory schema, writing triggers, reading logic, and integration based on testing outcomes.

By following these steps, an agent can systematically integrate and verify the use of session memory, becoming a more powerful and context-aware assistant for software engineers.
