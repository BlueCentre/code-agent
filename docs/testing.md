# Code Agent End-to-End Tests

This document records the verification tests performed on the Code Agent CLI after updating the default model to Gemini 2.0 Flash and fixing the API key access methods.

## Configuration Tests

### 1. Default Configuration Verification

```bash
code-agent config show
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the configuration reflects the updated default model.

**Result**: ✅ Configuration showed `gemini-2.0-flash` as the default model, confirming the update was successful.

### 2. Provider List Verification

```bash
code-agent providers list
```

**Purpose**: Confirm the default provider and model in the providers list.

**Result**: ✅ Output confirmed `ai_studio / gemini-2.0-flash` as the current default.

### 3. AI Studio Configuration Details

```bash
code-agent config aistudio
```

**Purpose**: Verify AI Studio configuration has been updated with the correct model information.

**Result**: ✅ Displayed correct model information with Gemini 2.0 Flash listed as the default and also included Gemini 2.0 Pro as an available model.

## Basic Functionality Tests

### 4. Simple Query Test

```bash
code-agent run "What is the Python version and how can I check it in the terminal?"
```

**Purpose**: Test basic query handling without tool execution.

**Result**: ✅ Agent responded correctly with information on how to check Python version.

### 5. Command Execution with Approval

```bash
code-agent run "List all Python files in the code_agent directory"
```

**Purpose**: Test that the agent requests approval before executing commands.

**Result**: ✅ Agent correctly asked for permission to execute the command.

### 6. Command Execution with Auto-Approval

```bash
echo y | code-agent run "Find all Python files in the code_agent directory and its subdirectories"
```

**Purpose**: Test command execution workflow when approval is provided.

**Result**: ✅ Command executed successfully after approval, listing Python files.

### 7. File Reading Test

```bash
code-agent run "Show me the first 10 lines of the README.md file"
```

**Purpose**: Verify file reading functionality.

**Result**: ✅ Agent successfully read and displayed the beginning of the README.md file.

## Model-Specific Tests

### 8. Alternative Model Test

```bash
code-agent --model gemini-1.5-flash run "Tell me a short joke about programming"
```

**Purpose**: Verify the ability to override the default model for a specific query.

**Result**: ✅ Successfully used the specified model instead of the default, generating a programming joke.

## Chat Mode Tests

### 9. Basic Chat Interaction

```bash
echo -e "Hello, what is your default model?\n/exit" | code-agent chat
```

**Purpose**: Test chat mode functionality with a simple interaction.

**Result**: ✅ Chat session initialized properly, though the response about the default model was generic.

## Test Summary

The end-to-end tests confirm that:

1. Configuration changes were successful across all parts of the system.
2. Basic functionality works correctly, including:
   - Text query processing
   - Command execution with approval
   - File operations
3. Model selection and overrides are working properly.
4. Chat mode functions correctly.

These tests provide confidence that the changes made to update the default model and fix the API key access methods have been implemented correctly and haven't broken any existing functionality.

## Future Test Improvements

For more robust testing, consider implementing:

1. Automated test scripts that can run these end-to-end tests programmatically
2. Expanded chat mode testing with multi-turn interactions
3. Edge case testing with invalid models and providers
4. Performance benchmarking between different models
