# Code Agent Implementation Plan & Status

> **Note**: The roadmap and next steps have been consolidated into the main task list at [docs/planning_priorities.md](planning_priorities.md). Please refer to that file for the current list of planned improvements, prioritized tasks, and future enhancements.

This document outlines the implementation steps that have been completed for the Code Agent project.

## Completed Implementation Steps

*   [x] **Project Setup & Foundation:**
    *   [x] Create directory structure (`code-agent/cli`, `code-agent/agent`, `code-agent/config`, `code-agent/tools`, `tests/`).
    *   [x] Initialize Git repository.
    *   [x] Set up `pyproject.toml` with Poetry.
    *   [x] Create virtual environment (`.venv`).
    *   [x] Install base dependencies (`typer`, `litellm`, `pyyaml`, `rich`, `pydantic`).
*   [x] **Configuration Management:**
    *   [x] Define `config.yaml` structure (`~/.config/code-agent/config.yaml`).
    *   [x] Implement `config.py` to load settings (File > Env > Defaults - *Note: CLI override not fully implemented yet*).
    *   [x] Implement validation using Pydantic.
*   [x] **Basic CLI Structure (Typer):**
    *   [x] Set up main entry point (`code_agent/cli/main.py`).
    *   [x] Define basic commands (`--version`, `config show`, `providers list`).
    *   [x] Parse global options (`--provider`, `--model`).
*   [x] **Core LLM Interaction (LiteLLM):**
    *   [x] Create `llm.py` wrapper around `litellm.completion` (Initially used, now integrated within agent).
    *   [x] Implement basic single-shot command (`code-agent run "prompt"`) using LiteLLM.
*   [x] **Agent Architecture:**
    *   [x] Refactor to create a structured `CodeAgent` class (`code_agent/agent/agent.py`).
    *   [x] Pass user input, configuration, and system prompt to the agent.
    *   [x] Implement complete tool calling loop within the agent.
*   [x] **Interactive Chat Mode:**
    *   [x] Implement `code-agent chat` command using a loop.
    *   [x] Implement basic in-memory history tracking.
    *   [x] Implement saving/loading history to timestamped JSON files (`~/code-agent/history/`).
    *   [x] Use `rich` for formatted input/output.
*   [x] **Output Formatting:**
    *   [x] Integrate `rich` for Markdown rendering and code syntax highlighting in both single-shot and chat modes.
*   [x] **Tool Use - Internal Tools (File I/O):**
    *   [x] Define `read_file(path)` tool (`code_agent/tools/simple_tools.py`).
    *   [x] Format tool definition for OpenAI standard.
    *   [x] Update agent logic to pass tool definitions to LLM.
    *   [x] Update agent instruction.
    *   [x] Implement tool call handling mechanism.
*   [x] **Tool Use - File Editing:**
    *   [x] Define `apply_edit(path, proposed_content)` tool (`code_agent/tools/simple_tools.py`).
    *   [x] Implement logic: calculate diff (`difflib`), display diff (`rich`), prompt for confirmation (`rich.prompt.Confirm`), apply changes if confirmed or `auto_approve_edits` is set.
    *   [x] Handle file errors.
    *   [x] Add tool to agent and update instruction.
*   [x] **Tool Use - Native Commands (Secure Execution):**
    *   [x] Define `run_native_command(command_string)` tool (`code_agent/tools/simple_tools.py`).
    *   [x] Implement security: Check `native_command_allowlist`, prompt for confirmation (respecting `auto_approve_native_commands`), use `subprocess.run` safely (`shlex.split`), capture output.
    *   [x] Add tool to agent and update instruction.
*   [x] **Rule-Based Guidance:**
    *   [x] Load rules from `config.yaml`.
    *   [x] Inject rules into the system prompt passed to the LLM.
*   [x] **Multi-Provider Support:**
    *   [x] Add specific support for AI Studio APIs.
    *   [x] Configure provider-specific API base URLs.
    *   [x] Implement provider-specific model string formatting.
    *   [x] Set AI Studio as default provider with Gemini models.
*   [x] **Refinement & Error Handling:**
    *   [x] Add robust `try...except` blocks for API calls, file ops, tool execution.
    *   [x] Add informative error messages for common issues (API key missing, rate limits, etc.)
    *   [x] Add user feedback during processing (`rich.status`).
    *   [x] Write initial unit tests (`pytest`) for config and tools.
    *   [x] Write initial integration tests for CLI (`typer.testing.CliRunner`).
*   [x] **Special Commands in Chat:**
    *   [x] Implement `/help` to show available commands
    *   [x] Implement `/clear` to clear conversation history
    *   [x] Implement `/exit` and `/quit` commands
    *   [x] Implement `/test` for automated testing purposes
*   [x] **Documentation & Packaging:**
    *   [x] Create `README.md` with setup, config, usage.
    *   [x] Set up packaging using `pyproject.toml` and Poetry.
    *   [x] Create initial `docs` folder structure.
