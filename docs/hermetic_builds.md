# Hermetic Build System Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a plan for implementing hermetic builds in the Code Agent project to ensure consistent behavior between local development environments and CI pipelines. Hermetic builds are self-contained, reproducible, and isolated from external factors, resulting in the same outputs given the same inputs regardless of when or where they're executed.

## Current Challenges

We've encountered several issues that highlight the need for hermetic builds:

1. **Dependency discrepancies**: Tests passing locally but failing in CI due to missing dependencies that weren't explicitly declared (e.g., pytest-mock)
2. **Configuration inconsistencies**: Different default configurations between environments leading to test failures
3. **Environment variables**: Unexpected environment variables affecting test outcomes
4. **Tool version mismatches**: Differing versions of Python, Poetry, or other tools causing subtle behavior changes

## Principles of Hermetic Builds

1. **Explicit declaration** of all inputs, dependencies, and configuration
2. **Isolation** from the host environment
3. **Reproducibility** across different machines and times
4. **Determinism** through versioning and pinning
5. **Version control** for all build inputs

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Development Container Standardization

Create a consistent, containerized development environment:

- Develop a standard Docker container for development that matches CI exactly
- Define container with:
  - Specific Python version
  - Pre-installed development tools with explicit versions
  - Project dependencies installed from lockfile
  - Default configuration files
- Enable VSCode remote container development

### 2. Dependency Management

Strengthen dependency management practices:

- Ensure all dependencies (including dev dependencies) are explicitly declared in pyproject.toml
- Maintain strict versioning in poetry.lock
- Add automated check to verify no undeclared dependencies are used
- Create dependency visualization/auditing

### 3. Configuration Isolation

Improve configuration handling to ensure consistency:

- Create separate test-specific configuration that overrides defaults
- Mock external configuration sources in tests
- Reset configuration between tests
- Add automatic validation of configuration assumptions

### 4. Test Environment Controls

Enhance test environment isolation:

- Create standard test fixtures that reset environment completely
- Explicitly control file system access in tests
- Mock external services consistently
- Create test-specific template files that are version controlled

### 5. CI Pipeline Improvements

Strengthen CI pipeline to catch inconsistencies:

- Run tests in both clean and cached environments
- Add explicit dependency verification step
- Add configuration validation step
- Test with multiple Python versions
- Test with different operating systems

### 6. Local Development Tooling

Provide tools to ensure local development matches CI:

- Create helper scripts for running tests in container
- Add pre-commit hooks to validate environment consistency
- Provide easy environment reset commands
- Add automated environment validation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Audit all project dependencies and ensure they're declared in pyproject.toml
   - Create container definition file for development environment
   - Add documentation for standard development setup

2. **Short-term Actions** (1-2 weeks):
   - Set up containerized test runs in CI
   - Create development container configuration
   - Add dependency verification step to CI
   - Implement configuration reset fixtures in tests

3. **Medium-term Actions** (2-4 weeks):
   - Develop helper scripts for local containerized development
   - Implement pre-commit hooks for environment validation
   - Create automated test for dependency completeness
   - Standardize test configuration

4. **Long-term Actions** (1-2 months):
   - Full test suite for configuration validation
   - Cross-platform testing integration
   - Automated dependency update verification
   - Integration with IDE tooling for environment validation

## Success Criteria

A successful hermetic build system will ensure:

1. Any test that passes in CI will pass locally and vice versa
2. A fresh checkout and build of the repository produces identical results every time
3. No "it works on my machine" issues occur
4. New contributors can onboard quickly with a consistent environment
5. Test failures are due to actual code issues, not environment differences

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Once implemented:

1. Regularly audit dependencies and configuration
2. Keep container definitions up to date
3. Include environment validation in code reviews
4. Document any deviations or exceptions needed
5. Track environment-related issues and analyze root causes
