# Code Agent End-to-End Tests

This document records the verification tests performed on the Code Agent CLI after updating the default model to Gemini 2.0 Flash and fixing the API key access methods.

## Configuration Tests

### 1. Default Configuration Verification

```bash
code-agent config show
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the configuration reflects the updated default model.

**Result**: ✅ Configuration showed `gemini-2.0-flash` as the default model, confirming the update was successful.

### 2. Provider List Verification

```bash
code-agent providers list
```

**Purpose**: Confirm the default provider and model in the providers list.

**Result**: ✅ Output confirmed `ai_studio / gemini-2.0-flash` as the current default.

### 3. AI Studio Configuration Details

```bash
code-agent config aistudio
```

**Purpose**: Verify AI Studio configuration has been updated with the correct model information.

**Result**: ✅ Displayed correct model information with Gemini 2.0 Flash listed as the default and also included Gemini 2.0 Pro as an available model.

## Basic Functionality Tests

### 4. Simple Query Test

```bash
code-agent run "What is the Python version and how can I check it in the terminal?"
```

**Purpose**: Test basic query handling without tool execution.

**Result**: ✅ Agent responded correctly with information on how to check Python version.

### 5. Command Execution with Approval

```bash
code-agent run "List all Python files in the code_agent directory"
```

**Purpose**: Test that the agent requests approval before executing commands.

**Result**: ✅ Agent correctly asked for permission to execute the command.

### 6. Command Execution with Auto-Approval

```bash
echo y | code-agent run "Find all Python files in the code_agent directory and its subdirectories"
```

**Purpose**: Test command execution workflow when approval is provided.

**Result**: ✅ Command executed successfully after approval, listing Python files.

### 7. File Reading Test

```bash
code-agent run "Show me the first 10 lines of the README.md file"
```

**Purpose**: Verify file reading functionality.

**Result**: ✅ Agent successfully read and displayed the beginning of the README.md file.

## Chat Mode Tests

### 9. Basic Chat Interaction

```bash
echo -e "Hello, what is your default model?\n/exit" | code-agent chat
```

**Purpose**: Test chat mode functionality with a simple interaction.

**Result**: ✅ Chat session initialized properly, though the response about the default model was generic.

## Advanced Use Case Tests

These complex scenarios test multiple capabilities together and reflect real-world usage patterns.

### 10. Code Analysis and Explanation

```bash
code-agent run "Analyze the code_agent/agent/agent.py file and explain what the CodeAgent class does, including its main methods and how it uses tools"
```

**Purpose**: Test the agent's ability to analyze more complex code structures, understand class relationships, and provide clear explanations.

**Expected Result**: The agent should read the file, identify the key components of the CodeAgent class, explain the tool-calling mechanism, and provide a comprehensive overview of how the agent framework functions.

### 11. Multi-Step File Operation

```bash
code-agent chat
# Enter the following prompts:
# 1. "Find Python files in the code_agent directory that import the 'rich' library"
# 2. "For the files you found, identify which 'rich' components each file is using"
# 3. "Create a summary report of rich library usage in our codebase and save it as docs/rich_usage.md"
# 4. "/exit"
```

**Purpose**: Test sequential reasoning, memory of previous responses, and file creation.

**Expected Result**: The agent should maintain context across multiple turns, execute searches for imports, analyze component usage patterns, and generate a structured markdown document with its findings.

### 12. Code Refactoring Suggestion

```bash
code-agent run "Analyze our error handling in code_agent/tools/*.py files and suggest a consistent approach to improve error handling. Include a specific code example of how we could refactor one of the error handling sections."
```

**Purpose**: Test code analysis across multiple files, pattern recognition, and ability to generate improvement suggestions with concrete examples.

**Expected Result**: The agent should identify current error handling patterns across the tool files, recognize inconsistencies or areas for improvement, and provide a specific refactoring example with code.

### 13. Command Chain with Dynamic Inputs

```bash
code-agent run "Find all TODO comments in our codebase, create a prioritized list based on their context, and save it as docs/planning_priorities.md"
```

**Purpose**: Test the agent's ability to chain commands where the output of one operation feeds into another, requiring synthesis and reorganization of information.

**Expected Result**: The agent should execute a grep-like search for TODOs, analyze the context of each to determine priority, organize them into a meaningful structure, and create a new markdown file.

### 14. Configuration File Analysis and Modification

```bash
code-agent run "Analyze our config.yaml template and suggest two additional configuration options that would be useful based on how the codebase uses configuration. Then show me how you would modify the template to include these options."
```

**Purpose**: Test deep understanding of the configuration system, including how values are used throughout the codebase, and the ability to make meaningful extensions.

**Expected Result**: The agent should analyze the configuration template, trace how configuration values are used in the codebase, suggest relevant additions, and demonstrate the YAML modifications needed.

### 15. Interactive Documentation Generation

```bash
# Set auto_approve_edits to true for this test
code-agent run "Create a comprehensive user guide for the 'code-agent config' command and all its subcommands. Include examples for each subcommand. Save it as docs/config_command_guide.md."
```

**Purpose**: Test the ability to gather information from multiple sources, synthesize documentation, and create a structured user guide.

**Expected Result**: The agent should identify all config subcommands, extract their functionality from the code, generate appropriate examples, and create a well-formatted markdown file.

### 16. Complex Error Simulation and Debugging

```bash
code-agent run "If I get the error 'Error during agent execution (AuthenticationError): Invalid API key', walk me through all the possible causes and debugging steps I should take to fix it."
```

**Purpose**: Test the agent's troubleshooting capabilities and knowledge of the system's error handling mechanisms.

**Expected Result**: The agent should provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide that covers various authentication scenarios, configuration locations, environment variables, and validation steps.

### 17. Configuration Validation and Security Checks

```bash
code-agent config validate --verbose
```

**Purpose**: Test the configuration validation system that ensures model compatibility with providers, API key format validation, command allowlist security checks, and identifies security risks in configuration settings.

**Expected Result**: The validation should check the current configuration for:
- Model compatibility with the selected provider
- API key format and presence
- Security concerns in command allowlist patterns
- Auto-approve settings that might pose security risks

When run with the verbose flag, it should display all validation details even if there are only warnings. If validation fails with errors, the command should exit with code 1, indicating failure.

## Model-Specific Tests

### 8. Alternative Model Test

```bash
code-agent --model gemini-1.5-flash run "Tell me a short joke about programming"
```

**Purpose**: Verify the ability to override the default model for a specific query.

**Result**: ✅ Successfully used the specified model instead of the default, generating a programming joke.

## Test Summary

The end-to-end tests confirm that:

1. Configuration changes were successful across all parts of the system.
2. Basic functionality works correctly, including:
   - Text query processing
   - Command execution with approval
   - File operations
3. Model selection and overrides are working properly.
4. Chat mode functions correctly.

These tests provide confidence that the changes made to update the default model and fix the API key access methods have been implemented correctly and haven't broken any existing functionality.

## Future Test Improvements

For more robust testing, consider implementing:

1. Automated test scripts that can run these end-to-end tests programmatically
2. Expanded chat mode testing with multi-turn interactions
3. Edge case testing with invalid models and providers
4. Performance benchmarking between different models
