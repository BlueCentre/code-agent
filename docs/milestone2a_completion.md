User Acceptance Testing Instructions:

1. Use the Verification Script to Test Tool Wrappers:

   ```bash
   # Run the verification script from the project root
   ./scripts/verify_adk_tool_wrappers.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check for the presence of required files
   - Run unit tests for all implemented tool wrappers
   - Display a summary of implemented and pending tools
   - Explain current limitations and next steps

2. Manually Verify Tool Implementations:

   ```bash
   # Run just the unit tests if preferred
   python -m pytest tests/unit/test_adk_tools.py -v
   ```

3. Review Code Structure and Patterns:

   ```bash
   # Examine the tool wrapper implementations
   cat code_agent/adk/tools.py
   
   # Review the test implementations
   cat tests/unit/test_adk_tools.py
   ```

4. Check Documentation for Accuracy:

   ```bash
   # Review UAT documentation
   cat docs/uat_milestone2_tools.md
   
   # Review status table
   cat docs/uat_status_table.md
   ```

Note: At this stage, do NOT attempt to test through the CLI using `code-agent run` 
commands, as the ADK agent implementation is not yet complete.
The wrappers exist and pass tests, but are not yet connected to an agent.
