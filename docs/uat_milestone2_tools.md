# User Acceptance Testing - Milestone 2: ADK Tool Wrappers

## Current Migration Status

This document outlines the verifiable items for the current milestone of the Google ADK migration. At this stage, we have implemented ADK tool wrappers but have not yet integrated them with a functioning ADK agent.

## Tool Categories and Implementation Status

| Tool Category | Tool Name | Wrapper Status | Integration Status |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| File Operations | `read_file` | ✅ Implemented | 🔄 Pending Agent Integration |
| File Operations | `delete_file` | ✅ Implemented | 🔄 Pending Agent Integration |
| File Operations | `apply_edit` | ✅ Implemented | 🔄 Pending Agent Integration |
| File Operations | `list_dir` | ✅ Implemented | 🔄 Pending Agent Integration |
| File Operations | `file_search` | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Integrated |
| Code Analysis | `codebase_search` | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Integrated |
| Code Analysis | `grep_search` | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Integrated |
| Terminal | `run_terminal_cmd` | ✅ Implemented | 🔄 Pending Agent Integration |
| Web | `web_search` | ❌ Not Implemented | ❌ Not Integrated |

## Verifiable Components

At this stage of the migration, the following components can be verified:

1. **ADK Tool Wrapper Implementations** - The code exists and tests are passing:
   - ✅ `code_agent/adk/tools.py` contains the tool wrapper implementations
   - ✅ `tests/unit/test_adk_tools.py` contains the unit tests for these wrappers

2. **ADK Integration Structure**:
   - ✅ The `code_agent/adk/__init__.py` properly exports the tool wrapper functions
   - ✅ The dependencies on Google ADK are properly configured in `pyproject.toml`

3. **Code Quality and Structure**:
   - ✅ Tools follow the recommended ADK patterns for tool implementation
   - ✅ Wrappers handle error cases and logging correctly

## Testing Instructions

For this milestone, testing should focus on the verification of the tool wrapper implementations in isolation, not their integration with an agent:

1. **Verify Tool Implementations**:
   ```bash
   # Run the unit tests for ADK tool wrappers
   python -m pytest tests/unit/test_adk_tools.py -v
   ```

2. **Review Code Structure**:
   - Examine `code_agent/adk/tools.py` to verify the implementation follows ADK patterns
   - Confirm that each tool follows consistent error handling and logging patterns

## Limitations and Next Steps

### Current Limitations:
- The ADK tool wrappers are not yet connected to a functioning ADK agent implementation
- The command line interface still uses the original non-ADK agent implementation
- Attempting to use tools through the command line will not utilize the ADK wrappers

### Next Steps in Migration:
1. Implement the ADK Agent (`code_agent/adk/agent.py`)
2. Connect the ADK tools to the ADK Agent
3. Update the CLI to use the ADK Agent implementation
4. Implement additional tool wrappers for remaining tools

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
1. The specific tool being tested
2. The test method used (unit test, code review)
3. The expected vs. actual behavior
4. Any error messages or logs
