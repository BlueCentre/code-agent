# Tool Categories and Implementation Status

## Current State of Google ADK Migration - Milestone 2

The following table shows the implementation status of tool wrappers for the Google ADK migration. Note that these are only the wrappers, which have not yet been connected to an ADK agent implementation.

| Tool Category | Tool Name | Wrapper Status | Integration Status | Implementation Location |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| File Operations | `read_file` | ✅ Completed | 🔄 Pending | `code_agent/adk/tools.py` |
| File Operations | `delete_file` | ✅ Completed | 🔄 Pending | `code_agent/adk/tools.py` |
| File Operations | `apply_edit` | ✅ Completed | 🔄 Pending | `code_agent/adk/tools.py` |
| File Operations | `list_dir` | ✅ Completed | 🔄 Pending | `code_agent/adk/tools.py` |
| File Operations | `file_search` | ❌ Not Started | ❌ Not Started | - |
| Code Analysis | `codebase_search` | ❌ Not Started | ❌ Not Started | - |
| Code Analysis | `grep_search` | ❌ Not Started | ❌ Not Started | - |
| Terminal | `run_terminal_cmd` | ✅ Completed | 🔄 Pending | `code_agent/adk/tools.py` |
| Web | `web_search` | ❌ Not Started | ❌ Not Started | - |

## Testing Strategies

1. **Unit Testing**: All implemented wrappers have unit tests in `tests/unit/test_adk_tools.py`
2. **Code Review**: Wrapper implementations follow ADK patterns and standards
3. **Security Review**: All wrappers properly handle security checks and validations

## Key Status Items:

- ✅ All implemented tool wrappers pass unit tests
- ✅ Project structure is aligned with migration plan
- ✅ Dependencies are correctly configured
- ❌ ADK Agent implementation not yet available
- ❌ CLI integration not yet implemented

## Next Development Phases:

1. Create ADK Agent implementation (`code_agent/adk/agent.py`)
2. Integrate ADK tools with ADK Agent
3. Update CLI to use ADK Agent
4. Implement remaining tool wrappers
