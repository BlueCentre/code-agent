# Plan for Integrating Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Goal

Enhance and extend our existing tools capabilities by integrating support for Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) without replacing the current toolset. Leverage existing MCP support in the `google-adk` library.

## Background

Claude's MCP allows for richer interactions with the model by providing a structured way to manage context and tool usage. Integrating MCP will enable more sophisticated tool orchestration and potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of our tools.

## Proposed Approach

1.  **Explore `google-adk` MCP Support:**
    *   Thoroughly review the existing MCP support within the `google-adk` library.
    *   Identify the key classes, methods, and interfaces that can be utilized for our integration.
    *   Understand how the `google-adk` handles tool registration, context management, and response parsing within the MCP framework.

2.  **Define MCP Tool Interface:**
    *   Create an abstract interface or base class for MCP-enabled tools.
    *   This interface should define methods for:
        *   Registering the tool with the MCP.
        *   Handling MCP requests.
        *   Formatting tool responses according to MCP.

3.  **Implement MCP Adapters for Existing Tools:**
    *   Develop adapter classes that wrap our existing tools and implement the MCP tool interface.
    *   These adapters will translate MCP requests into calls to our existing tools and format the tool responses into MCP-compatible responses.
    *   This approach allows us to reuse our current tools without modifying their core logic.

4.  **Context Management:**
    *   Implement a context management system that integrates with the MCP.
    *   This system should be able to:
        *   Store and retrieve context information associated with each interaction.
        *   Pass relevant context information to the tools.
        *   Update the context based on tool responses.

5.  **Orchestration Layer:**
    *   Create an orchestration layer that manages the interaction between the MCP, the context management system, and the tools.
    *   This layer will be responsible for:
        *   Receiving MCP requests.
        *   Selecting the appropriate tools based on the request and context.
        *   Passing the request and context to the selected tools.
        *   Formatting the tool responses and returning them to the MCP.

6.  **Testing:**
    *   Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the correct functionality of the MCP integration.
    *   Test cases should cover:
        *   Tool registration.
        *   Request handling.
        *   Response formatting.
        *   Context management.
        *   Orchestration.

7.  **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy the MCP integration in a phased approach.
    *   Start with a small set of tools and gradually expand the integration to more tools.
    *   Monitor the performance and stability of the integration closely.

## Integration with `google-adk`

*   Utilize the relevant classes and methods from the `google-adk` library to handle the underlying MCP communication and data structures.
*   Ensure that our tool adapters are compatible with the `google-adk`'s MCP implementation.

## Benefits

*   Enhanced tool capabilities through richer context and structured interactions.
*   Improved tool orchestration and accuracy.
*   Reusability of existing tools without major modifications.
*   Leveraging the existing MCP support in the `google-adk` library.

## Risks and Challenges

*   Complexity of integrating with the MCP and the `google-adk`.
*   Potential performance overhead due to the additional layers of abstraction.
*   Ensuring compatibility between our existing tools and the MCP.

## Next Steps

*   Detailed investigation of the `google-adk` MCP support.
*   Design and implement the MCP tool interface and adapters.
*   Develop the context management system and orchestration layer.
