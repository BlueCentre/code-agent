# Web Search Feature Validation

This document outlines the validation tests for the web search feature in the Code Agent CLI.

## Implementation Status Update

**Current State**: Reverted to stable version (commit f7ef7843c7a6c83fb1f1d32cedbb4abb41edaa46)

Due to ongoing challenges with DuckDuckGo rate limiting and status display conflicts, we've reverted to the last stable version of the web search implementation. This version has the core functionality but doesn't include the additional error handling and timeout mechanisms that were being developed.

### Working Features
- Basic web search functionality via DuckDuckGo
- Error handling for disabled web search
- Result formatting with titles, content and source URLs
- Handling for missing fields in results

### Known Limitations
- No timeout mechanism for web search operations
- Status display conflicts may occur
- Rate limiting from DuckDuckGo service

## Basic Web Search Tests

### 1. Web Search in Run Mode

```bash
code-agent run "What are the latest features in Python 3.12? Use web search to find out."
```

**Purpose**: Verify that web search works in one-shot run mode.

**Expected Result**: Agent should search the web and provide information about Python 3.12 features.

### 2. Web Search in Chat Mode

```bash
code-agent chat
# Enter: "What are the latest features in Python 3.12?"
# Enter: "/exit"
```

**Purpose**: Verify that web search works in interactive chat mode.

**Expected Result**: Agent should search the web and provide information about Python 3.12 features.

## Configuration Tests

### 3. Web Search Disabled Test

```bash
# Manually edit ~/.config/code-agent/config.yaml and set enable_web_search: false
code-agent run "What are the latest features in Python 3.12?"
# Re-enable web search by setting enable_web_search: true
```

**Purpose**: Verify that the agent properly handles disabled web search.

**Expected Result**: Agent should indicate that web search is disabled and suggest alternatives.

## Advanced Use Case Tests

### 4. Current Events Query

```bash
code-agent run "What were the major technology announcements in the last week? Provide a brief summary."
```

**Purpose**: Test the agent's ability to find recent information that wouldn't be in its training data.

**Expected Result**: Agent should provide recent tech announcements by searching the web.

## Development Roadmap

For future improvements to the web search feature, the following items should be addressed:

1. **Rate Limiting Management**:
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Add request caching to reduce duplicate requests
   - Consider adding a search result cache

2. **Display Conflict Resolution**:
   - Redesign status handling to use a single coordinated status manager
   - Implement a queue system for status updates
   - Simplify to plain text logging for secondary operations

3. **Timeout Implementation**:
   - Add configurable timeouts for web search operations
   - Add graceful handling of timeouts
   - Provide clear error messages when timeouts occur

4. **Alternative Search Providers**:
   - Add support for multiple search engines
   - Implement failover between providers
   - Consider using a paid API with higher rate limits for production use
