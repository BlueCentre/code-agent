## Future Improvements

This section outlines potential improvements to the code_agent project to enhance the user experience.

### 1. More Granular User Confirmation

*   **Contextual Confirmation:** Enhance the confirmation prompts for `apply_edit` and `run_native_command` by providing more context.
    *   For `apply_edit`, include a snippet of the code being changed alongside the diff.  Consider using a more readable diff format.
    *   For `run_native_command`, explain the reasoning behind the command execution.  This could involve summarizing the agent's plan or goal.

*   **Diff Highlighting:** Improve the diff output in `apply_edit` with more distinct color-coding and formatting for added/removed lines to enhance readability. Leverage the capabilities of the `rich` library for improved visual presentation.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Reporting

*   **More Informative Error Messages:** Provide user-friendly and actionable error messages for file operation failures (e.g., file not found, permission denied). Suggest potential solutions or troubleshooting steps.
*   **Structured Error Logging:** Implement structured logging (e.g., using the `logging` module) to capture errors and warnings with timestamps, log levels, and relevant context.  Provide a mechanism for users to access and analyze these logs, potentially through a dedicated log viewer or integration with a logging service.

### 3. Streamlined Configuration

*   **Dynamic Configuration Validation:** Validate the configuration file on startup and provide clear error messages for invalid values or missing settings. Consider using a schema validation library to enforce the configuration structure.
*   **Configuration Editor Tool:** Develop a tool (CLI command or web interface) to simplify the creation and modification of the configuration file. This tool could provide autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and validation feedback.

### 4. Improved Command History and Recall

*   **Command History:** Implement a command history feature in the CLI for easy recall and re-execution of previous commands. This could be achieved using a library like `readline` or a custom implementation.
*   **Session Management:** Allow users to save and restore agent sessions to resume work where they left off. This could involve serializing the agent's state to a file and loading it upon startup.

### 5. Enhanced Security Measures

*   **Stricter Command Allowlist:** Review and refine the command allowlist for `run_native_command` with more specific command patterns and restrictions on potentially dangerous commands. Regularly audit the allowlist and update it as needed.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Implement input sanitization to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in `run_native_command`. Use appropriate escaping and validation techniques to ensure that user-provided input cannot be used to execute arbitrary commands.

### 6. Asynchronous Operations

*   **Background Execution:** Use asynchronous execution (e.g., using `asyncio` or `threading`) for long-running operations (e.g., running native commands, large file reads) to prevent the CLI from freezing. Provide progress updates to the user, such as a progress bar or a percentage indicator.

### 7. Better Feedback on Agent Progress

*   **Thinking Indicator:** Display a visual indicator (e.g., a spinning animation or "Thinking..." message) while the agent is processing a request.
*   **Step-by-Step Output:** Show the user each step as it's being executed for tasks involving multiple steps. This could involve logging each step to the console or providing a more detailed visualization of the agent's workflow.
