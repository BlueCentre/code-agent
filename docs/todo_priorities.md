# Consolidated Priority Task List

This document consolidates all tasks, improvements, and future enhancements for the Code Agent project into a single prioritized reference.

## High Priority

- **Tool Enhancement**
  - Add support for tools/function calling in LLM integration [from todo_priorities]
  - Enhance security checks for `apply_edit` and `run_native_command` (e.g., stricter path validation) [from implementation.md]
  - Add size limits and pagination to `read_file` [from implementation.md]
  - Add timeout and working directory options to native tools [from todo_priorities]

- **Configuration Improvements**
  - Fully implement the CLI > Env > File hierarchy for all configuration options [from implementation.md]
  - Use pydantic-settings for more robust env var handling [from todo_priorities]
  - Implement dynamic configuration validation with clear error messages [from future_improvements.md]

- **User Experience Improvements**
  - Enhance confirmation prompts with more context and better diff highlighting [from future_improvements.md]
  - Implement "thinking indicator" and step-by-step output for complex operations [from future_improvements.md]

## Medium Priority

- **Provider Support Enhancement**
  - Test integration with local models (Ollama) [from implementation.md]
  - Improve provider-specific configuration options [from implementation.md]

- **History Management**
  - Add option to load specific history files [from implementation.md]
  - Implement improved command history and recall in CLI [from future_improvements.md]
  - Enhance session management (save/restore agent sessions) [from future_improvements.md]

- **Code Quality**
  - Fix linting issues (line length, trailing whitespace, etc.) [from implementation.md]
  - Ensure consistent code style across the codebase [from implementation.md]
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and linting [from implementation.md]

## Low Priority

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Implement stricter command allowlist with more specific patterns [from future_improvements.md]
  - Add input sanitization to prevent command injection vulnerabilities [from future_improvements.md]

- **Testing Improvements**
  - Add checks for warning print messages in tests (requires capsys) [from todo_priorities]
  - Add contribution guidelines with code style requirements [from implementation.md]

- **Packaging & Distribution**
  - Finalize packaging for distribution (e.g., PyPI) [from implementation.md]
  - Implement changelog tracking [from implementation.md]

## Future Enhancements

- **Asynchronous Operations**
  - Implement background execution for long-running operations [from future_improvements.md]
  - Use asyncio or threading to prevent CLI freezing during processing [from future_improvements.md]

- **Advanced Memory Management**
  - Implement long-term conversation memory using vector databases [from PLAN.md]
  - Add knowledge extraction and summarization for extended conversations [from PLAN.md]
  - Develop context windowing techniques for managing token limits [from PLAN.md]

- **Extended Tool Capabilities**

  - Add Git-specific tooling for repository management [from PLAN.md]
  - Develop project analysis tools for codebase understanding [from PLAN.md]
  - Integrate with code quality tools and test runners [from PLAN.md]

- **Enhanced Collaboration**
  - Implement session sharing between team members [from PLAN.md]
  - Add history export and import features [from PLAN.md]
  - Develop collaborative editing capabilities [from PLAN.md]

- **User Interface Improvements**
  - Create optional TUI (Text User Interface) with interactive components [from PLAN.md]
  - Add terminal-based code editor integration [from PLAN.md]
  - Implement syntax-highlighted diffs with interactive application [from PLAN.md]

- **Integration Possibilities**
  - Develop integration with IDEs via plugins/extensions [from PLAN.md]
  - Enhance integration with version control systems [from PLAN.md]
  - Create CI/CD pipeline integration [from PLAN.md]

- **Customization**
